Hi there! I'd be happy to help you with your Sigma Web Development course.

You asked where block elements are taught in this course. Well, let me check the video chunks for you!

It looks like the topic of inline and block elements is covered in Video 8 of your course. You can go to that specific video and start playing from around the 2-minute mark (specifically at timestamp 495 seconds). In that section, you'll find an explanation on what makes a block element.

To be more precise, the video starts explaining this concept shortly after the 2-minute mark, starting from approximately 495 seconds, where it says "Block element?" and also around 203 seconds into the same video segment (where it mentions "A block element").
